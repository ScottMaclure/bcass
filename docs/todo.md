## Sooner

* Lay out some elements in index.html to mock FE test screen.jpg (client-side only)
* Grab some images for the product data
* Cherry pick some colours from the jpg and link with F4's semantic colours: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html

## Later

* Setup a node.js / express server
* Setup grunt to compile / compress / minify etc
