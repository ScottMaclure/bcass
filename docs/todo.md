# BCASS Todo

## Sooner

* Grab some images for the product data
* Render/style RHS bar to look like the jpg
* Refactor app scss into file/folder structure (sass-globbing?)
* Write some custom JS (perhaps an ajax search?)

## Later

* IE7 testing and support strategy (need to get VM XP serial/activation first)
* Consider: remove dependency on zurb-foundation gem, add foundation sass directly to project (consider upgrade path though. Temptation to tweak foundation itself?)
* Consider: sass-globbing: So you can do @import "library/**/*"
