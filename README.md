# Big Commerce - Senior FE Assignment

## Assignment

Your challenge is to replicate the attached screenshots of the homepage of a mocked store front
template. You are free to build the interface as you deem appropriate (front end frameworks; JS libs;
web standards; OOCSS).

Think of this page as part of a much larger site (i.e. don’t treat this as just the one page), and think about
how components (for example, the sidebar widget) can be easily re-used in other parts of the page and
site. 

We are expecting that your code will be ‘production like’, so take care.
